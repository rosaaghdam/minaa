## Description

**MiNAA** aligns two networks based their topologies and biologies.

## Requirements

This program requires C++20 or higher.

## Compilation

### Unix

`make`

### Windows

```cmd
mkdir obj
make
```

In addition to C++20, Windows requires a special means to run the provided makefile. The MinGW Package Manager provides a lightweight make function. It is recommended to follow [this guide](https://linuxhint.com/run-makefile-windows/), however any method for compiling C++ should suffice.

## Usage

This utility takes two to five command-line arguments: `./minaa.exe <G> <H> [-B=bio] [-a=alpha] [-b=beta]`

### Required Arguments (ordered)

1. **G**: A network to align.
2. **H**: A network to align.

- Require:
  - The networks are represented by adjacency matrices in CSV format, with labels in both the first column and row.
  - The CSV delimiter must be one of {comma, semicolon, space, tab}, and will be detected automatically.
  - Any nonzero entry is considered an edge.
  - |G| should be lesser or equal to |H|.

### Optional Arguments (unordered)

- **bio**: The path to the biological cost matrix file.
  - Require: CSV adjacency matrix where the first column is the labels of G, and first row is the labels of H.
  - Default: the algorithm will run using only topological calculations.
- **alpha**: GDV-edge weight balancer
  - Require: a real number in range [0, 1].
  - Default: 1
- **beta**: topological-biological cost matrix balancer.
  - Require: a real number in range [0, 1].
  - Default: 1

### Outputs

- **X-Y-T/**: (where "X", "Y" are the input networks, "T" is the date and time of execution) The folder containing the output files specified below.
- **log.txt**: Record of the important details from the alignment.
- **X_gdvs.csv**: (where "X" is the input network) The Graphlet Degree Vectors for network "X".
- **top_costs.csv**: The topological cost matrix.
- **bio_costs.csv**: The biologocal cost matrix (as inputed). Not created unless biological input is given.
- **overall_costs.csv**: The combination of the topological and biological cost matrix. Not created unless biological input is given.
- **alignment_list.csv**: A complete list of all aligned nodes, with rows in the format `g_node,h_node,similarity`, descending acording to similarity. The first row in this list is the total cost of the alignment, or the sum of (1 - similarity) for all aligned pairs.
- **alignment_matrix.csv**: A matrix form of the same alignment, where the first column and row are the labels from the two input networks, respectively.

### Examples

`./minaa.exe network0.csv network1.csv -a=0.6`

Here we align network0 with network1 using no biological data. `-a=0.6` sets alpha equal to 0.6, meaning 60% of the topological cost function comes from similarity calculated by GDVs, and 40% from simpler node degree data.

`./minaa.exe network0.csv network1.csv bio_costs.csv -b=0.85`

Here we align network0 with network1 using topological information and the given biological cost matrix, bio_costs. Since alpha and gamma were unspecified, they default to 0.5 and 1 respectively. Since beta was set to 0.85, 85% of the cost weight is from the topological cost matrix, and 15% is from the given biological cost matrix.
