## Description

**MiNAA** is a network alignment algorithm. That is, MiNAA takes as input a pair of node-edge networks, and finds a correspondance between them such that each node in one is mapped to its most similar node in the other. MiNAA is capable of using both *topological* (structural) information about the network, and *biological* information about the taxa each node represents, in order to produce a good approximation of the optimal alignment. Due to the complexity of this task, an approximation is the best that can be done in an efficient runtime. Network alignment in this setting is done primarily for comparative purposes. For example, an alignment might map clusters of taxa to each other, revealing conserved or analogous functions between microbial communities. See our [software note](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05880) (preprint) for additional details.

## Requirements

This program requires C++20 or higher, and g++.

## Compilation

### Unix

`make`

### Windows

```cmd
mkdir obj
make
```

In addition to C++20 and g++, Windows requires a special means to run the provided makefile. The MinGW Package Manager provides a lightweight make function. It is recommended to download MinGW [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), and follow [this guide](https://linuxhint.com/run-makefile-windows/) for installation, however any method for compiling C++ using g++ should suffice.

## Usage

This utility has the form `./minaa.exe <G> <H> [-B=bio] [-a=alpha] [-b=beta]`.

### Required Arguments (ordered)

1. **G**: A network to align.
2. **H**: A network to align.

- Require:
  - The networks are represented by adjacency matrices in CSV format, with labels in both the first column and row.
  - The CSV delimiter must be one of {comma, semicolon, space, tab}, and will be detected automatically.
  - Any nonzero entry is considered an edge.
  - |G| should be lesser or equal to |H|.

### Optional Arguments (unordered)

- **bio**: The path to the biological cost matrix file.
  - Require: CSV adjacency matrix where the first column consists of the labels of G, and first row consists of the labels of H.
  - Default: the algorithm will run using only topological calculations.
- **alpha**: GDV-edge weight balancer
  - Require: a real number in range [0, 1].
  - Default: 1
- **beta**: topological-biological cost matrix balancer.
  - Require: a real number in range [0, 1].
  - Default: 1

### Outputs

- **X-Y-T/**: (where "X", "Y" are the input networks, "T" is the date and time of execution) The folder containing the output files specified below.
- **log.txt**: Record of the important details from the alignment.
- **X_gdvs.csv**: (where "X" is the input network) The Graphlet Degree Vectors for network "X".
- **top_costs.csv**: The topological cost matrix.
- **bio_costs.csv**: The biologocal cost matrix (as inputed). Not created unless biological input is given.
- **overall_costs.csv**: The combination of the topological and biological cost matrix. Not created unless biological input is given.
- **alignment_list.csv**: A complete list of all aligned nodes, with rows in the format `g_node,h_node,similarity`, descending acording to similarity. The first row in this list is the total cost of the alignment, or the sum of (1 - similarity) for all aligned pairs.
- **alignment_matrix.csv**: A matrix form of the same alignment, where the first column and row are the labels from the two input networks, respectively.

### Examples

`./minaa.exe network0.csv network1.csv -a=0.6`

Here we align network0 with network1 using no biological data. `-a=0.6` sets alpha equal to 0.6, meaning 60% of the topological cost function comes from similarity calculated by GDVs, and 40% from simpler node degree data.

`./minaa.exe network0.csv network1.csv bio_costs.csv -b=0.85`

Here we align network0 with network1 using topological information and the given biological cost matrix, bio_costs. Since alpha and gamma were unspecified, they default to 0.5 and 1 respectively. Since beta was set to 0.85, 85% of the cost weight is from the topological cost matrix, and 15% is from the given biological cost matrix.
